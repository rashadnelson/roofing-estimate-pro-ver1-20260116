### 🧱 Conceptual Data Model (in words)

- **User**  
  - `id`, `email`, `subscription_tier`, `stripe_status`  
  - `subscription_tier`: "free" | "monthly" | "annual"
  - `estimates_this_month`: counter for free tier limit (resets monthly)
  - No estimate data stored—just auth and subscription info.

- **Estimate (Client-side only)**  
  - `equipmentCost`, `materialsCost`, `laborHours`, `laborRate`, `discountPercent`  
  - Derived values: `laborTotal`, `subtotal`, `discountAmount`, `finalPrice`, `tieredPrices[]`  
  - Logo + company name = session-only inputs for export (Annual tier only for logo).
  - Free tier: watermark added to PDF exports

- **Saved Templates (Monthly/Annual only)**  
  - `id`, `user_id`, `name`, `equipmentCost`, `materialsCost`, `laborHours`, `laborRate`, `discountPercent`
  - Stored server-side for paid users only

---

### ✨ UI Design Principles

- Bold, dark aesthetic with crimson accents—premium and trade-focused
- Large inputs, ample spacing, clear labels—optimized for on-site use
- WCAG AA+ compliant typography and color (high contrast on dark backgrounds)
- Mobile-first design for field technicians
- Dark hero sections with subtle cross pattern texture
- Warm cream sections provide visual breathing room
- Every interaction respects the user's workflow:
  - Success = clear feedback with checkmarks
  - Error = helpful guidance without alarm
  - Export = professional control with prominent CTAs

> Inspired by Krug's law: *"Don't make me think."*

---

### 🔐 Security & Compliance Notes

- No estimate data stored server-side (estimates are always client-side)
- Saved templates (Monthly/Annual) stored encrypted with user association
- Stripe handles all payments (PCI-compliant)
- Better-Auth handles session management with secure, httpOnly cookies
- Password reset tokens are single-use and expire after 1 hour
- Logo upload (Annual tier) is ephemeral—not stored, just used for in-memory PDF generation
- Free tier estimate counter resets monthly (server-side tracking)
- All frontend forms ARIA-labeled and fully keyboard-navigable

---

### 🛣 Roadmap (Phased)

**MVP**  
- Landing page  
- Signup + Stripe flow  
- Dashboard inputs + live estimate  
- Copy & PDF export  
- Logo/name support (no storage)
- Favicon updated with site logo
- Basic SEO (meta tags, Open Graph, sitemap)

**V1**  
- Usage analytics (opt-in, anonymized)  
- PDF styling themes (classic, modern, bold)  
- Export history (local browser storage)
- Line item descriptions for detailed breakdowns

**V2**  
- "Smart Pricing" AI suggestions based on job type  
- Save customer profiles (with consent)  
- Offline mode (PWA) for no-signal job sites
- Common plumbing job templates (water heater, drain cleaning, fixture install)

---

### ⚠️ Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Users think data is stored | Reassuring copy + visual cues: "Nothing is saved" |
| Overwhelmed by export options | Keep only two: Copy or PDF |
| Trust issues with pricing math | Transparent breakdown; no hidden calculations |
| Mobile layout breaks on job sites | Test against real workflows on small screens |
| Field technicians need offline access | PWA mode planned for V2 |
| Free tier abuse (multiple accounts) | Rate limiting, email verification required |
| Unclear tier differences | Clear comparison table, feature badges in dashboard |
| Watermark too intrusive | Subtle "Created with PlumbPro Estimate" footer placement |

---

### 🚀 Future Expansion Ideas

- White-label mode (custom domain + PDF theme)
- Customer portal (view + approve estimates)
- Zapier/QuickBooks integration
- Parts catalog with pricing database
- Multi-job estimate bundling

**Key design decisions:**
- Dark backgrounds feel modern and reduce eye strain during long quote sessions
- Crimson red commands attention for CTAs without feeling aggressive
- Animated cycling text ("accurate", "professional", "fast") adds energy without distraction

## 🔧 Plumbpro Estimate: Calculation Logic

---

### 📊 Input Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| Equipment Cost | Currency ($) | Cost of equipment (water heaters, fixtures, etc.) |
| Materials Cost | Currency ($) | Cost of parts and supplies (pipes, fittings, etc.) |
| Labor Hours | Number | Total hours for the job |
| Labor Rate | Currency ($/hr) | Hourly rate for labor |
| Discount % | Percentage (0-100) | Overall discount to apply |

---

### 🧮 Calculation Formulas

```
Labor Total = Labor Hours × Labor Rate
Subtotal = Equipment Cost + Materials Cost + Labor Total
Discount Amount = Subtotal × (Discount % / 100)
Final Price = Subtotal - Discount Amount
```

---

### 📈 Tiered Pricing

| Tier | Multiplier | Use Case |
|------|------------|----------|
| Standard | 1.00× | Normal scheduling |
| Priority | 1.15× | Same-week service |
| Emergency | 1.30× | Same-day/after-hours |

```
Tiered Price = Final Price × Tier Multiplier
```

---

### 💡 Example Calculation

**Inputs:**
- Equipment Cost: $450
- Materials Cost: $125
- Labor Hours: 4
- Labor Rate: $85/hr
- Discount: 10%

**Outputs:**
- Labor Total: 4 × $85 = $340
- Subtotal: $450 + $125 + $340 = $915
- Discount Amount: $915 × 0.10 = $91.50
- Final Price: $915 - $91.50 = $823.50

**Tiered Options:**
- Standard: $823.50
- Priority: $947.03
- Emergency: $1,070.55
